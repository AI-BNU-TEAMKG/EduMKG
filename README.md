### EduMKG: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph for Education with Text, Video, Image and Audio
EduMKG is a multimodal educational knowledge graph dataset that covers natural sciences (biology, physics, and chemistry) in middle and high school education. It includes multimodal concepts covering text, images, videos, and audio, as well as knowledge points and exercises extracted from curriculum standards and MOOCs. EduMKG comprises 34,630 multimodal concepts and 403,400 triples, making it a vital resource for research in multimodal educational applications.

This repository contains the models and datasets described in our paper, `EduMKG: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph for Education with Text, Image, Video and Audio`

#### Validation Results for Alignment Quality
To validate the alignment quality, we randomly sampled 100 multimodal concepts and asked 5 volunteers to assess them. The quantitative results will be added to the paper.
| Modality       | Volunteer 1 | Volunteer 2 | Volunteer 3 | Volunteer 4 | Volunteer 5 | Average Score | 
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Text               | 89              | 92              | 88              | 91              | 90              | 90.0             | 
| Image              | 87              | 89              | 88              | 90              | 88              | 88.4             |
| Video              | 83              | 85              | 86              | 84              | 82              | 84.0             | 
| Audio              | 89              | 92              | 88              | 91              | 90              | 90.0             | 

Key Details:  
- Volunteer Feedback: Each volunteer rated the alignment quality of multimodal concepts on a scale of 0 to 100.  
- Average Score: Arithmetic mean of scores from five volunteers.  


##### SPARQL Endpoint Url and Usage Instructions
We have open-sourced the RDF data of EduMKG on Zenodo and provided an automation script for converting JSON to RDF format in this code repository. You can execute the script by following the steps below:

1. Install `rdflib`  
```shell  
pip install rdflib  
```  

2. Configure the paths for the input JSON file and the output file, then run `rdf.py`:  
```python  
python rdf.py  
```
3. Accessing the SPARQL Endpoint and Performing Queries: We provide an example for reference.  
* Access the [Apache Jena Fuseki UI](http://103.36.221.18:46469/#/).  
* Enter the username and password: `user`, `userPassword`.  
* Example usage:
  
  Example 1
  ```sparql
  # Randomly select 10 sets of "subject-predicate-object" triplet data from the database and display them.
  PREFIX ex: <http://v1.edumkg.org/>
  SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
  WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object
  }
  LIMIT 10
  ```
  Example 2
   ```sparql
   # Query the concept of ‚Äú‰∏äËáÇÈ™®È™ºËÇå‚Äù corresponding to its explanation
   PREFIX ex: <http://v1.edumkg.org/>
   SELECT ?explanation
   WHERE {
   ?concept a ex:Concept .
   ?concept ex:hasAnExplanation ?explanation .
   FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?concept), ENCODE_FOR_URI("‰∏äËáÇÈ™®È™ºËÇå")))
   }
   ```
