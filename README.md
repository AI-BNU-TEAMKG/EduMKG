### EduMKG: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph for Education with Text, Video, Image and Audio
EduMKG is a multimodal educational knowledge graph dataset that covers natural sciences (biology, physics, and chemistry) in middle and high school education. It includes multimodal concepts covering text, images, videos, and audio, as well as knowledge points and exercises extracted from curriculum standards and MOOCs. EduMKG comprises 34,630 multimodal concepts and 403,400 triples, making it a vital resource for research in multimodal educational applications.

This repository contains the models and datasets described in our paper, `EduMKG: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph for Education with Text, Image, Video and Audio`

##### SPARQL Endpoint Url and Usage Instructions
We have open-sourced the RDF data of EduMKG on Zenodo and provided an automation script for converting JSON to RDF format in this code repository. You can execute the script by following the steps below:

1. Install `rdflib`  
```shell  
pip install rdflib  
```  

2. Configure the paths for the input JSON file and the output file, then run `rdf.py`:  
```python  
python rdf.py  
```
3. Accessing the SPARQL Endpoint and Performing Queries: We provide an example for reference.  
* Access the [Apache Jena Fuseki UI](http://103.36.221.18:46469/#/).  
* Enter the username and password: `user`, `userPassword`.  
* Example usage:
  
  Example 1
  ```sparql
  # Randomly select 10 sets of "subject-predicate-object" triplet data from the database and display them.
  PREFIX ex: <http://v1.edumkg.org/>
  SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
  WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object
  }
  LIMIT 10
  ```
  Example 2
   ```sparql
   # Query the concept of ‚Äú‰∏äËáÇÈ™®È™ºËÇå‚Äù corresponding to its explanation
   PREFIX ex: <http://v1.edumkg.org/>
   SELECT ?explanation
   WHERE {
   ?concept a ex:Concept .
   ?concept ex:hasAnExplanation ?explanation .
   FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?concept), ENCODE_FOR_URI("‰∏äËáÇÈ™®È™ºËÇå")))
   }
   ```
#### Future Work
In the future, we will update the following aspects:  
1. Expand the coverage of the dataset to include a broader range of subjects and educational stages, thereby improving its applicability and generalizability.  
2. Provide educational application research compatible with EduMKG, such as prerequisite knowledge discovery and personalized education system recommendations.  
3. Explore more efficient model designs to refine the proposed methods and broaden their practical applications in educational contexts.
   
We look forward to the research community further exploring and utilizing this dataset to advance education and applied research related to multimodal educational knowledge graphs.
